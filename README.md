# Auto-Logger
## 1.Purpose
- https://openerp.dailyopt.ai/ is a website that my university (Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam) use to assign coding problems for students and grade their work.
- The main purpose of this repository is to practice python coding and the use of selenium library.
## 2.How to use it?
- The AutoLogin.py file contains scripts that can open Firefox browser, go to the web page, fill-in username and password to enter (Well of course I don't include the username and password, that would be silly!!!)
- The geckodriver.exe is the Firefox webdriver, without it, the code won't work
